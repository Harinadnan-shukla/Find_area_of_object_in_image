**Object Detection and Area Calculation**

This repository contains code for performing object detection on an input image using a pre-trained object detection model and calculating the areas of the detected objects. The implementation is based on PyTorch and utilizes the COCO dataset labels for object classification.

**Steps Involved:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have the required dependencies installed by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
   ```

2. **Load Pre-trained Object Detection Model:**
   Load a pre-trained object detection model. You can choose a suitable model from the PyTorch torchvision library or other available models.

3. **Define COCO Class Names:**
   Define the COCO dataset labels in the `COCO_CLASS_NAMES` list. This list maps the class indices to human-readable labels.

4. **Define Image Transformation:**
   The `transform` function is used to transform the input image into a format that can be fed into the object detection model.

5. **Calculate Area and Process Image:**
   The `process_image` function takes the image path and confidence threshold as input and performs object detection on the image using the pre-trained model. It calculates the areas of the detected objects in pixels and returns the areas along with the corresponding class labels and bounding box coordinates.

6. **Plot Image with Bounding Boxes and Labels:**
   The `plot_image_with_bboxes` function takes the original image and the detected objects as input and draws bounding boxes around the detected objects. It also labels the objects with their class names and area in pixels.

7. **Detect and Plot Objects:**
   The `detect_and_plot_objects` function is a user-defined function that combines the above steps. It loads the input image, detects objects, calculates their areas, and then displays the original image with bounding boxes and labels for the detected objects.

**Usage:**
- Replace `path_to_your_image.jpg` in the `detect_and_plot_objects` function with the path to your input image.
- Load your pre-trained object detection model and pass it as an argument to the `detect_and_plot_objects` function.
- Set the `confidence_threshold` parameter to control the confidence level for object detection. Adjust as needed.
- Run the script to perform object detection and area calculation on the input image.



**Contributions:**
Contributions and improvements to the code are welcome! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for enhancements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
